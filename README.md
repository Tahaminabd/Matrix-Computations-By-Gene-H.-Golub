## About the Book

"Matrix Computations" by Gene H. Golub is a fundamental text in the field of numerical linear algebra. It covers various topics related to matrices, their properties, and algorithms for solving matrix problems. This repository contains solutions to select exercises from the book to help learners better understand the concepts presented in the text.

## Solutions

You can find solutions to exercises organized by chapter in this repository. Each solution is implemented in a Julia Pluto.jl notebook for interactive exploration. You can view and run the notebooks in your browser.

## Getting Started

To access and interact with the solutions, you'll need to have Julia and Pluto.jl installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Julia: Download and install Julia from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pluto.jl: Open a Julia REPL and execute the following command to install Pluto.jl:

   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("Pluto")
   
## Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/Tahaminabd/matrix-computations-solutions.git

## Run Pluto.jl

`ìmport Pluto
Pluto.run()`

####



This will open the Pluto notebook in your web browser, where you can interact with the solutions.
